"# Music-Player-with-Javascript-HTML-and-CSS" 
This application uses a bunch of functions together with the Adio object in javascript to create a functional music player. You can play, rewind and fast-foward the tracks.
To use this app you'll have to replace the songs in the songs array with the songs in your local machine.
